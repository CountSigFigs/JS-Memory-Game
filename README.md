# JS-Memory-Game
Vanilla JS memory game 


This is a game I created with the idea and help from freeCodeCamp.org;

To play the game, select a card for it to be flipped over. Try to find the matching card by flipping over another one.
If it is a match, they will stay turned over, otherwise they will turn back over. The game ends when you have found all
matching pairs. 

Hit the reset button to start the game over.
